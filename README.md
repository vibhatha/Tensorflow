## Tensorboard
To run tensorboard examples

```python
	python3 SGD/sgd_benchmark.py
```

Then on another terminal 

```bash
	cd SGD
	tensorboard --logdir=output_sgd_benchmark
```

Then go to the ip address shown in the console window ...
In my case it is 

```bash
	http://vibhatha-ThinkPad-p50:6006
```
